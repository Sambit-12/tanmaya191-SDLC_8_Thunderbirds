## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

### Day 1 

#### Challenges Faced - All having different ideas and thoughts. All ideas were unique and intresting which create lots of confusion to select the project.

#### Overcome - At the end of second meeting we finally select the project.

#### Overcome - Each team member is very active and hard working. So, we easily overcome that challenge.


### Day 3

#### Challenges Faced - We all started working on different application. While working on respective code of application face some issues. 

#### Overcome - We all share our problem in team group. So, member who know the solution share with others.
