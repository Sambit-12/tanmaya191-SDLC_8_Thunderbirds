## Requirements üìù

### Introduction
In this project, a new system is designed to perform various electrical and electronics calculations and conversions. This system allows the user to solve problems quickly and in an efficient manner.

### Research

### Ohm‚Äôs Law
*	In electronics, Ohm‚Äôs law is vitally important to describe the circuits, as it relates voltage to the current with the resistance value.
*	This law was derived by the German Physicist, George Simon Ohm.
*  Ohm‚Äôs law is used to maintain the desired voltage drop across the electronic components and it is used in DC ammeter and other DC shunts to divert the current. Its application also ranges from household appliances to massive projects.
*  With this feature which exhibits ohm's law we can play with basic electrical parameters like voltage, current and resistance.

### Kirchoff‚Äôs Current Law (KCL)
* It is first Kirchoff‚Äôs law that deals with the conservation of charge.
* The law states that total current entering a junction or node is exactly equal to the charge leaving the node as it has no place to go except to leave, as no charge is lost within the node.
* This feature also calculates the current flowing towards the circuit and current flowing away from the circuit seperately.

### Kirchoff‚Äôs Voltage law (KVL)
* It is the second law that deals with the conservation of energy around a closed circuit path.
* It states that for a closed loop series path the algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero.
* It is used for voltage measurement in circuits.
* Using this feature we can find voltages in each loops of any multi-loop system and also the total voltage passing through the system.

### Duty cycle
*	Duty cycle is the ratio of time a load or circuit is ON compared to the time the load or circuit is OFF.
*	It is expressed as a percentage of ON time.

### Motor parameters
*	The motor parameters include frequency, output power, speed and torque. The speed of a motor depends on the rotational velocity of the motor shaft and torque is a rotating force produced by an engine‚Äôs crankshaft. 
*	The relation between torque and speed are inversely proportional to each other. 
*	Frequency is the rate at which current changes its direction per second in a machine. The output power is   calculated with the help of input power and losses in the motor.

### Half Adder 
*	It is a arithmetic combinational logic circuit designed to perform addition of two single bits.
* It contain two inputs and produces two outputs.
* Inputs are called Augend and Added bits and Outputs are called Sum and Carry.
*	Sum =  A XOR B
*	Carry= A AND B 

### Half Subtractor
* It is a combinational logic circuit designed to perform subtraction of two single bits.
* It contains two inputs (A and B) and produces two outputs (Difference and Borrow-output).
* Difference = A XOR B
* Borrow     =!A AND B

### PCB Trace Width
*	The trace is a conducting track that connects connects components electrically and allows electric current to flow with little resistance.
*	The single trace on Printed circuit Board(PCB) is the equivalent of a wire for conducting signals. Each trace consists of flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching.
*	The PCB trace widths are dependent on the needs of the signal. The thinner traces are for general purpose Transistor-Transistor Logic(TTL) signals and the thicker traces are optimized for current carrying capacity and used for high power-related functions

### Resistor Colour Code
*	In 1920, the resistor colour code was developed by Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) as a fixed resistor colour coding. This colour coding is used to quickly identify the resistive value and its percentage of tolerance. 
*	The most popular mnemonic created to easily memorize the sequence of colours is BBROYGBVGW.
*	The composition has 3 to 6 resistor colour bands.  The three band resistor is for multiplier with no tolerance, 4 band resistor with one tolerance band, 5 band resistor with 4 multipliers and one tolerance bond, 6 band resistor have an additional band as temperature coefficient.

### Current division & Voltage division
*	Current Divider Circuits are parallel circuits in which the source or supply current divides into a number of parallel paths.
*	All the components have their terminals connected together sharing the same two end nodes.
*	A voltage divider is a simple circuit which turns a large voltage into a smaller one.
*	Voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider.

### Star and Delta Conversions
*	In a 3-phase, 3-wire supply or 3-phase load is connected in one type (Star/Delta), it can be easily changed into an equivalent type (Delta/Star) by using either Start Delta transformation or Delta Star transformation.
*	When three branches are connected nose to tail, they form a triangular closed loop, it is referred as Delta connection. Whereas the terminals are connected to a common point to form a Y like pattern, is is referred as Star connection.
*	This conversion is used to establish equivalence for the networks within the terminals.

### Selection of multi and single core wire
*	The conductor cross-section shall be chosen such that the conductor withstands prospective short circuit current for a specified duration of time.
*	Area of cross-section of the conductor shall be sized to carry estimated load current continuously such that the temperature rise of the conductor is within the acceptable limits for the installation conditions foreseen
*	Voltage drop within the cable is within the permissible limits so that the functionality of the connected load by the cable remains unaffected

### Equivalent Capacitance and Inductance of Circuits
*   The equivalent capacitance and inductance of a circuit can be calculated by their equivalent formulas
*   Passive components in parallel and series circuits add up in ratios relating to their properties

### Tensile strength
* Tensile strength is the amount of load or stress that can be handled by a material before it stretches and breaks.
* It is the material‚Äôs resistance to tension that is caused by mechanical loads applied to the material.
* It measures the force required to pull something such as rope, wire or a structural beam to the point where it breaks.
* Different conductors with different tensile strength are used for thier respective applications.
* Using this feature the user can get to opt the suitable conductor for his/her application

### Circular Convolution
* Circular convolution is a special case of periodic convolution, which is the convolution of two periodic functions that have the same period.
* It is the mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal.
* Linear Convolution is the basic operation to calculate the output for any linear time invariant system. Circular convolution is the same thing but considering that the support of the signal is periodic.


## Cost and Features
*	This system saves a lot of time for the user and results in quick and accurate manner.
*	The heavy calculations are made simple with this system and it can be accessed easily.

## Defining our system
*	In this system, the essential parameters are obtained from the user as input and this system will compute the values depending on the choice made by the user for calculation.
